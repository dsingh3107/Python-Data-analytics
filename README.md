🏅 Decathlon Alpha — Data-Driven Retail Optimization Project
📘 Overview

Decathlon Alpha is a Python-based data analysis project designed to uncover insights from SCCR sheet data (Store/Cluster Commercial Report) of Decathlon. The project focuses on analyzing business performance across multiple dimensions such as walk-ins, turnover, profitability, shrinkage, and teammate efficiency.

The goal is to create a data-driven decision-support system that helps store leaders and cluster heads understand which factors drive business growth and how to optimize team performance, customer experience, and inventory efficiency.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze store performance trends (walk-ins, turnover, conversion rates).

Identify top-performing sports and departments based on sales and margin.

Evaluate teammate performance and efficiency through scorecard data.

Examine P&L components, including shrinkage, piloting, and profitability.

Correlate operational metrics (like walk-ins and efficiency) with business results.

🧩 Dataset Description

The database includes multiple interconnected sheets:

Sheet Name	Description
Walk-ins	Daily/weekly count of store visitors
Turnover	Sales performance by sport/department
P&L	Profit and loss details by department
Shrinkage	Data on product loss and wastage
Piloting	Results of experimental initiatives
Teammate Scorecards	KPIs for each teammate (sales, behavior, knowledge, etc.)
Efficiency	Metrics on productivity per hour/team
Roster	Shift planning and manpower allocation
🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data Visualization: Matplotlib / Power BI (for dashboard extensions)

Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📊 Key Insights (Example Outcomes)

Found that conversion rate and teammate efficiency strongly correlate with turnover.

Identified high-margin sports contributing most to profit despite lower sales volume.

Detected patterns in shrinkage related to high stock movement weeks.

Created a store performance scorecard ranking departments by growth and efficiency.

🚀 Future Scope

Build a Power BI dashboard to visualize KPIs across months.

Integrate predictive modeling to forecast turnover or shrinkage.

Automate weekly report generation with Python scripts.

Compare multiple stores or clusters for benchmarking.
